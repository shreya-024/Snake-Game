# 🐍 Hand-Tracked Snake Game

A modern twist on the classic Snake game — play using just your index finger, tracked in real-time via your webcam! Built using Python, OpenCV, pygame, and cvzone.

---

## 🎮 Features

- 🖐️ **Hand Gesture Control**: Move the snake using your index finger — no keyboard needed.
- 🍎 **Multiple Food Types**: Randomly spawning banana, apple, and donut images.
- 🐍 **Snake Growth Mechanism**: Each food increases your snake’s length.
- 💥 **Game Over Logic**: Collision with the snake’s own body ends the game.
- 🔊 **Sound Effects**: Fun sounds play when you eat or collide.
- 🧠 **High Score Memory**: Highest score persists across sessions (stored in `score.txt`).
- 📸 **Live Webcam Feed**: Integrated directly into gameplay using OpenCV.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **OpenCV** – for webcam access, frame processing, and drawing.
- **cvzone** – for easy hand tracking and image overlays.
- **pygame** – for handling sound effects.
- **MediaPipe** (via cvzone) – for detecting and tracking the index finger.
